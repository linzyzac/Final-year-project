# Final year project
The repository contains the codes of all data preprocessing steps taken, as well as the codes of the end-to-end training and testing process of all traditional machine learning models. These are found in the file "Data Preprocessing and Traditional ML". Additionaly the rest of the uploaded files in the repository, correspond to the codes of each convolutional neural network employed in this study with its training, evaluation and testing process, specifying the corresponding CNN in the tile of each file.
