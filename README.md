The repository contains the codes all data preprocessing steps taken and end-to-end training and testing of all traditional machine learning models in the file "Data Preprocessing and Traditional ML". Additionaly the rest of the uploaded files correspond to each convolutional neural network employed in this study with its training, evaluation and testing process, specifying the corresponding CNN in the tile of each file.
